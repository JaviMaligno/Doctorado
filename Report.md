# Nigel Smart Fund Report

**Student name:** Javier Aguilar Mart√≠n

**Supervisor:** Constanze Roitzheim

**Conference title:** Homotopy theory, K-theory, and trace methods

**Place:** University of Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands

**Dates:** From 5th of July to 7th of July 2023


## Summary

This is a report of the impact of the travel bursary that I was granted as a succesful applicant of the Nigel Smart Fund. 

## Impact

Thanks to this travel bursary I was able to travel to the conference mentioned above and it also covered all additional expenses. The attendance to this conference offered me some exposure to current topics in the research of Homotopy theory, K-theory and trace methods. Since my field of expertice is Homotopy theory, I was able to find connections between my field and other related fields such as K-theory. This opened the door to new research questions and potential answers. 

In the conference I had multiple opportunities to discuss my research with other mathematicians and share some ideas. This allowed me to build a network that would be very beneficial for the continuation of my research. In particular, I met Steffen Sagave, the creator of derived $A_\infty$-algebras. These algebras are the central object of my thesis, so meeting the mathematician who introduced them was key to discuss the details of my results and gain a deeper understanding of the subject. 

This event was also an opportunity to share my findings with the mathematical community, which had an important impact on my reputation as a mathematician as well as on the University of Kent a research institution.

## Costs

The total costs derived from the attendance to the conference was 768GBP, well below the originally estimated 900GBP. These costs were divided into 477.50GBP spent directly by the University of Kent on flights and accommodation, and 290.50GBP reimbursed as expenses derived from transport and subsistence.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Professor Nigel Smart, the CEMS division and my supervisor for supporting my attendance to the aforementioned conference, since this had a very positive impact in my career.
