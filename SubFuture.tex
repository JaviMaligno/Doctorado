\section{Future research}

We finish by outlining some question that remain open after our research that would be interesting to investigate in the future. These questions arise naturally from the work done with (derived) $A_\infty$-algebras and from the classical results by Gerstenhaber and Voronov \cite{GV}.

\subsection{Hochschild Cohomology}
Let us review the Hochschild cohomology of an associative operad in order to understand the question that we will be asking about the (derived) $A_\infty$-case.

Let $\OO$ be an operad with an associative multiplication $m$, i.e. an $A_\infty$-multiplication $m$ REFERENCE) such that $m=m_2$. In this case, REFERENCE TO A-INFTY RESULT we have a dg-algebra structure on $S\s\OO$ given by the differential
\[d(Sx) =  Sb_1(m; x) -(-1)^{|x|}Sb_1(x; m)\]
and the multiplication
\[m(Sx,Sy) = Sb_2(m;x,y).\]

In particular, if $OO = \End_{SA}$ is the endomorphism operad of an associative algebra $A$ (such as $\s\PP$ for an operad $\PP$ with associative multiplication), these maps provide a dg-algebra structure on the Hochschild complex of $A$. We can then take cohomology with respect to $d$ to compute the Hochschild cohomology of $A$, denoted by $HH*(A)$. It is known that $m$ and the bracket 
\[[x,y]=Sb_1(x; y) -(-1)^{|x||y|}Sb_1(y; x)\]
induce a structure of a Gerstenhaber algebra on $HH*(A)$ \cite{GV}[Corollary 5].

PROBLEMS IN THE A-INFTY CASE
\subsection{Morphism}
About how could $\Phi$ connected morphisms, it's not even clear what notion of morphism to use because if you have $O\to P$ and it is not clear how to get $P^n\to P$ from $O^n\to O$.
