	abstract = {This paper investigates if a differential graded algebra can have more than one \$A\_{\textbackslash}infty\$-structure extending the given differential graded algebra structure. We give a sufficient condition for uniqueness of such an \$A\_{\textbackslash}infty\$-structure up to quasi-isomorphism using Hochschild cohomology. We then extend this condition to Sagave's notion of derived \$A\_{\textbackslash}infty\$-algebras after introducing a notion of Hochschild cohomology that applies to this.},
