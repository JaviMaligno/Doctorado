	title = {Cartan homotopy formulas and the {Gauss}-{Manin} connection in cyclic homology},
	abstract = {It is well-known that the periodic cyclic homology HP{\textbullet}(A) of an algebra A is homotopy invariant (see Connes [3], Goodwillie [8] and Block [1]). Let A be an algebra over a field k and let A$\nu$ be a formal deformation of A, that is, an associative product m$\nu$ ? Hom(A(x)2, A)[[$\nu$1,..., $\nu$n]] such thatm{\textbar}$\nu$=0 is the product on A. We will define a connection on the periodic cyclic bar complex of A$\nu$ for which the differential is covariant constant, thus inducing a connection on the periodic homology HP{\textbullet}(A$\nu$), thought of as a module over k[[$\nu$1,..., $\nu$n]]. This connection generalizes the classical Gauss-Manin connection, and indeed we will prove that it has curvature chain homotopic to zero. The Gauss-Manin connection is obtained by a generalization of Rinehart{\textquoteright}s result: if D is a derivation on A, then the operator uL(D) on the cyclic bar complex C(A)[[u]] of A is chain homotopic to zero (see Rinehart [10], and also Goodwillie [8]). Inspired by the work of Nistor [9], we prove a more general result on the action of the cochains C{\textbullet}(A,A) on the cyclic bar complex C(A), where A is an A$\infty$-algebra. (Recall that A$\infty$-algebras are a generalization of differential graded algebras. It is shown in [6] that A$\infty$-algebras form a natural setting for the study of cyclic homology.) The author would like to thank J. Block, V. Nistor, D. Quillen and B. Tsygan for helpful conversations on the subject of this article; in particular, the term Gauss-Manin connection is used at Quillen{\textquoteright}s suggestion. Note that some similar formulas, in the setting of Hochschild homology, have been obtained by Gelfand, Daletsk{\u i}{\i} and Tsygan [4].},

	abstract = {Using five basic principles, we treat Gerstenhaber/Lie brackets, Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) operators, and master equations appearing in mathematical and physical contexts in a unified way. The different contexts for this are given by the different types of (Feynman) graphs that underlie the particular situation. Two of the maxims we bring forth are (1) that extending to the non-connected graphs gives a commutative multiplication forming a part of the BV structure and (2) that there is a universal odd twist that unifies and explains seemingly ad hoc choices of signs and is responsible for the BV operator being a differential. Our treatment results in uniform, general theorems. These allow us to prove new results and recover and connect many constructions that have appeared independently throughout the literature. The more general point of view also allows us to disentangle the necessary from the circumstantial.},

	isbn = {978-3-642-30361-6},
	url = {https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642303616},
	abstract = {In many areas of mathematics some {\textquotedblleft}higher operations{\textquotedblright} are arising. These havebecome so important that several research projects refer to such expressions. Higher operationsform new types of algebras. The key to understanding and comparing them, to creating invariants of their action is operad theory. This is a point of view that is 40 years old in algebraic topology, but the new trend is its appearance in several other areas, such as algebraic geometry, mathematical physics, differential geometry, and combinatorics. The present volume is the first comprehensive and systematic approach to algebraic operads. An operad is an algebraic device that serves to study all kinds of algebras (associative, commutative, Lie, Poisson, A-infinity, etc.) from a conceptual point of view. The book presents this topic with an emphasis on Koszul duality theory. After a modern treatment of Koszul duality for associative algebras, the theory is extended to operads. Applications to homotopy algebra are given, for instance the Homotopy Transfer Theorem. Although the necessary notions of algebra are recalled, readers are expected to be familiar with elementary homological algebra. Each chapter ends with a helpful summary and exercises. A full chapter is devoted to examples, and numerous figures are included. After a low-level chapter on Algebra, accessible to (advanced) undergraduate students, the level increases gradually through the book. However, the authors have done their best to make it suitable for graduate students: three appendices review the basic results needed in order to understand the various chapters. Since higher algebra is becoming essential in several research areas like deformation theory, algebraic geometry, representation theory, differential geometry, algebraic combinatorics, and mathematical physics, the book can also be used as a reference work by researchers.},

An associative algebra is a special case of an A$\infty$ algebra, determined by a quadratic codifferential. The notions of Hochschild and cyclic cohomology generalize from associative to A$\infty$ algebras, and classify the infinitesimal deformations of the algebra, and those deformations preserving an invariant inner product, respectively. Similarly, an L$\infty$ algebra is given by a codifferential on the exterior coalgebra of a vector space, with Lie algebras being special cases given by quadratic codifferentials. There are natural definitions of cohomology and cyclic cohomology, generalizing the usual Lie algebra cohomology and cyclic cohomology, which classify deformations of the algebra and those which preserve an invariant inner product. This article explores the definitions of these infinity algebras, their cohomology and cyclic cohomology, and the relation to their infinitesimal deformations.},
